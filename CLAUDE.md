# Working on Rollcall

This repository is public. Never publish details of a real network in code, comments,
docs, changelogs, commit messages or test data:

- No real domain names, computer names, account names, IP addresses, phone or SIP providers,
  ports or serial numbers taken from a user's environment, logs or screenshots.
- Use generic stand-ins instead: domain `CONTOSO` / `contoso.local` / `example.local`,
  computers `PC01`, `SRV01`, `DC01`, accounts `svc_backup`, `admin`, addresses `192.168.1.x`
  or `10.0.1.x`, hosts `server.example.local`, providers `sip.provider.example`.
- When a fix comes from a user's real log line, rewrite the example before it goes in
  the changelog or docs.

## Changelog entries for GitHub issues

- When a change comes from a GitHub issue or request, link the issue in its changelog entry and thank
  the person who raised it, e.g. `([#4](https://github.com/shoey79/rollcall/issues/4), thanks to
  [name](https://github.com/name) for the request)`. Their GitHub username is public, so it's fine to use.
- Don't write a bare `@name` in commit messages (it notifies them); link the profile in the changelog instead.

## Queued changes

Small changes the owner has asked for, to include with the next bigger release (not on their own).
Remove each line once it's released.

- Rename the menu item **Manage > Add computer** to **Add device** (and its dialog title, docs and any other
  wording that says "Add computer" for the same thing).
